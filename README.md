# Box-Game
A basic box game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of an assignment for an internship.

In order for the game to work, please click on the boxes and then use your arrow keys to move them.

Note : If the canvas isn't highlighted (with a slight black border), then the functionality might not work as intended.
